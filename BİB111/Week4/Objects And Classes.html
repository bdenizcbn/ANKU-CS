                        Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name
                        suggests uses objects in programming.
                        Object-oriented programming aims to
                        implement real-world entities like
                        inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,
                        etc in programming. The main
                        aim of OOP is to bind together the data
                        and the functions that operate on them
                        so that no other part of the code can
                        access this data except that function.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Object : </b>An Object is an identifiable
                        entity with some characteristics and behavior.
                        An Object is an instance of a Class. When a
                        class is defined, no memory is allocated but
                        when it is instantiated (i.e. an
                        object is created) memory is allocated.
                        <br>
                        <b>Class : </b>The building block of C++ that
                        leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.
                        It is a user-defined data type, which holds its
                        own data members and member functions, which can
                        be accessed & used by creating an instance
                        of that class. A class is like a blueprint for
                        an object. For Example: Consider the Class
                        of Cars. There may be many cars with different
                        names and brand but all of them will share
                        some common properties like all of them will
                        have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc.
                        So here, Car is the class and wheels,
                        speed limits, mileage are their properties.
