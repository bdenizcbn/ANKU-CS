                        In normal terms Encapsulation is defined
                        as wrapping up of data and information
                        under a single unit. In Object Oriented
                        Programming, Encapsulation is defined as
                        binding together the data and the functions
                        that manipulates them. Consider
                        a real life example
                        of encapsulation, in a company there are
                        different sections like the accounts section,
                        finance section, sales section etc. The finance
                        section handles all the financial transactions
                        and keep records of all the data related to
                        finance.
                        Similarly the sales section handles all the
                        sales related activities and keep records of
                        all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
                        when for some reason an official from finance
                        section needs all the data about sales in a
                        particular
                        month. In this case, he is not allowed to
                        directly access the data of sales section.
                        He will first have to contact some other
                        officer in the sales section and then
                        request him to
                        give the particular data. This is what
                        encapsulation is. Here the data of
                        sales section and the
                        employees that can manipulate them are
                        wrapped under a single name “sales section”.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction
                        or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides
                        the data. In the above example the data of
                        any of the section like sales, finance or
                        accounts is hidden from any other section.<br>
                        In C++ encapsulation
                        can be implemented using Class
                        and access modifiers.
