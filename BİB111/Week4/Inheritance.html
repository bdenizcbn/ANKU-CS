                    The capability of a class to derive
                    properties and characteristics from
                    another class is called Inheritance.
                    Inheritance is one of the most important
                    feature of Object Oriented Programming.
                    Sub Class: The class that inherits
                    properties from another class
                    is called Sub class or Derived Class.
                    Super Class: The class whose properties
                    are inherited by sub class is called Base
                    Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we
                    have to write the functions only one time
                    instead of three times as we
                    have inherited rest of the three classes
                    from base class(Vehicle).
                </p>
                <p> 
                    <b>Mode of Inheritance : </b><br><br>

                    <b>Public Mode : </b>If we derive a sub
                    class from a public base class. Then the
                    public member of the base class will
                    become public in the derived class and
                    protected members of the base class
                    will become protected in derived class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Protected Mode : </b>If we derive a
                    sub class from a Protected base class.
                    Then both public member and protected
                    members of the base class will become
                    protected in derived class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Private Mode : </b>If we derive a
                    sub class from a Private base class.
                    Then both public member and protected
                    members of the base class will become
                    Private in derived class.

                    <b>Types of Inheritance in C++ : </b>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <b>Single Inheritance :</b> In single
                    inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit
                    from only one class. i.e. one sub class
                    is inherited by one base class only.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Multiple Inheritance :</b> Multiple
                    Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a
                    class can inherit from more than one
                    classes. i.e one sub class is inherited
                    from more than one base classes.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Multilevel Inheritance :</b> In this
                    type of inheritance, a derived class is
                    created from another derived class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Hieratical Inheritance :</b> In this
                    type of inheritance, more than one sub
                    class is inherited from a single base
                    class i.e. more than one derived class
                    is created from a single base class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance :</b>
                    Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by
                    combining more than one type of
                    inheritance.
                    For example: Combining Hierarchical
                    inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.
